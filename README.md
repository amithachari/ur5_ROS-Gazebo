# ur5_ROS-Gazebo
Simulation of UR5 on gazebo to pick and place blocks based on the size and shape of each block to sort them.

This is the project for Introduction to Robotics The task of the project is to sort the blocks on a conveyor, pick and place each of the blocks into different place based on the weight of the block. The main goal of the robot is to pick and place task given certain inputs.

#Implementation of the task in Gazebo

Steps to start the simulation
1. Create your catkin_ws/src folder
2. Cmake the folder
3. Download the ur5_ROS_Gazebo_src folder
4. Extract it in catkin_ws/src folder
5. Go back to catkin_ws and catkin_make
6. cd ..
7. Once extracting is done, open a new terminal to run the simulation
9. catkin_ws/source devel/setup.bash
10. catkin_ws$ roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5_initialize.launch
